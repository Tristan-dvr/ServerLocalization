The mod allows you to update the localization on the client side from the server side the way you want.

Localization files must be stored on `BepInEx\config\ServerLocalization` folder on server side only.
All localization files must have the json extension and be stored in a folder with the name of the language. You can store multiple language folders and multiple localization files inside each folder.

Here is an example of file `BepInEx\config\ServerLocalization\English\example.json`
```
{
   "first_key": "First key",
   "second_key": "Second key"
}
```

Make you easily add and update localized quests using `Marketplace And Server NPCs Revamped`.
Or for localization of random messages by using `Server Messages` or its analogs.
Or replace some vanilla text on your server to make it unique. Anyway, your choice)
